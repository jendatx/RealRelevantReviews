Here, we treat the user query as the 2nd segment and ask the BERT model to tell us how likely it is that the content of the query is addressed in the 1st segment.

'write down how deep your feelings for it are.  Jacob Jankowski is now ninety '\n"," 'three years old and in an \"assisted living\" facility, when the circus comes '\n"," 'to town.  This brings back startling memories of his early life, when his '\n"," 'world fell apart and he found himself on a circus train heading into his '\n"," 'future.On the brink of passing his final exams for veterinary school, Jacob '\n"," 'is informed that his parents have just died in an automobile accident.  '\n"," 'Adding insult to injury, their house and practice were mortgaged to pay for '\n"," \"his school and there's nothing left for Jacob.  He walks out of his final \"\n"," 'exam and keeps walking, until finding himself beside a railroad track.  '\n"," \"Jumping the next train, he later realizes it's a circus train.  An old man \"\n"," 'named Camel helps him out, and gets him hired on with the show as the '\n"," 'veterinarian.Jacob winds out bunking with a recalcitrant dwarf named Kinko '\n"," \"and working for a man named August who's married to Marlena, a horse \"\n"," \"performer and a beautiful woman.  Marlena is off-limits, but Jacob can't \"\n"," 'help but admire her from afar.A twist of fate bring Rosie to the scene, an '\n"," 'elephant abandoned by another defunct circus.  It seems Rosie is useless as '\n"," \"a performer, and left under August's brutal treatments, until Jacob \"\n"," 'discovers that Rosie responds to the Polish language rather than English.  '\n"," 'Once the language barrier is broken, Rosie becomes a star.  I could keep '\n"," \"prattling on but I don't want to ruin the book.'Water For Elephants' is a \"\n"," \"beautifully written tale.  Switching back and forth between Jacob's current \"\n"," \"situation in his nursing home and his memories of the past, there's never a \"\n"," \"slow moment in Gruen's perfect prose.  The story is rich and well \"\n"," 'researched, the characters practically sparkle with life, and I could smell '\n"," 'the animals and feel the train lurching beneath my feet.This is one of the '\n"," \"best books I've read in a long time.  I suppose it helps that I love circus \"\n"," \"books and freak show books, but 'Water For Elephants' is more a book on \"\n"," 'humanity, and what sometimes lurks beneath the smiles and happy faces of '\n"," \"troubled minds.  It's about greed and cliques, its about the depression era \"\n"," 'job desperation, its about abuse, and most of all its about the human '\n"," \"heart.  Don't miss out on this 10 star tale.  Enjoy!\")\n","Review 2\n","(\"Sara Gruen did a fantastic job of recreating the circus life in the 1930's \"\n"," 'as well as presenting us with the daily struggles of living of a '\n"," \"contemporary man in his 90's who lives in a nursing home.  This man is the \"\n"," 'main protagonist of the novel, who recounts his story from his last days in '\n"," 'vet school whose life trajectory takes him to the circus after a tragic '\n"," 'incident.  The novel is rich with visual imagery of circus life - the '\n"," 'animals, the workers, the performers, the props, the train travel etc - and '\n"," 'as rich with the depressing conditions of a nanogenarian living in a nursing '\n"," 'home - the daily struggles to handle basic life skills, relationships with '\n"," 'the staff and other residents, and, saddest of all, the knowledge of the '\n"," \"sense of loss of one's memory, and with that, the eventual loss of \"\n"," 'connection to relatives.  The narrative moves quickly and aggressively, '\n"," 'taking the reader back and forth between the circus and the nursing home, '\n"," 'with each venue progressing dramatically towards its conclusion.  The main '\n"," 'charcater, Jacob, is sympathetic, and you root for him all the way, '\n"," 'accompanying him along his travails of adjustment to circus life and his '\n"," 'love interest.  You get wrapped up in the drama and stay along eagerly on '\n"," 'the ride.Here are my minor objections(The first is directed at author and '\n"," 'editor.):  In a span of two pages the author uses the exact same phrase '\n"," \"regarding some anticipated emotion from different characters.  It's jarring \"\n"," 'to read, and you go back to see if you misread it - but no.  Not a big deal '\n"," 'but it interrupted the flow.  Bad enough, but the same phrase (or almost the '\n"," 'exact same phrase) appears again near the end of the book about the same '\n"," \"emotion, and, once again, I'm jarred and lose the focus of the story.  It \"\n"," 'seems like an amateurish mistake by author or editor.The other problem I had '\n"," 'was that, at times, some of the circus characters were borderline '\n"," 'stereoptypical/cartoonish, as if the protagonist is one of a few only real '\n"," 'people.  Finally, the concluding chapter had some elements to it of a '\n"," 'Hollywood happy ending, with an implausible change of attention from tragedy '\n"," 'to negotiation.')\n","Review 3\n","('So great I read it twice - and am reviewing both versions at once!Jacob is '\n"," 'in the last weeks of veterinary school at Cornell when he is hit with a '\n"," 'massive shock: the death of both of his beloved parents, and more '\n"," 'importantly the loss of everything he owns to the bank.  This is the throws '\n"," 'of the Depression.  He does what every man would do in his situation, hops a '\n"," 'train to anywhere only to find out it is the circus train of The Benzini '\n"," \"Bros. Greatest Show on Earth!  As the show's veterinarian he forms a close \"\n"," 'relationship with crazy August (the equestrian trainer), his wife Marlena (a '\n"," 'performer), and Rosie (the elephant).  As the days go on, life on the circus '\n"," 'gets crazier and crazier, until one day all hell breaks loose.  What will '\n"," 'Jacob do next?This book is narrated by two voices - that of the 90 something '\n"," 'year old Jacob (retelling the events as he remembers them) and that of the '\n"," '20 something year old Jacob (experiencing the events).  The audiobook did an '\n"," 'amazing job of casting two narrators and it made it one of the best books I '\n"," 'have listened too.  You were easily able to tell at what time you were by '\n"," 'who was narrating and it made it feel so real.Gruen does an amazing job of '\n"," 'researching the life of circus workers during the Depression.  At no time '\n"," 'did I feel that the details were out of place.  You could feel the '\n"," 'desperation of the roustabouts when they were continually not paid, resorted '\n"," 'to drinking bootleg liquor, ran out of food.  Reading this book was like '\n"," 'stepping back in time.I loved this book!  It is easily very near the top of '\n"," 'my favorite books list.  According to the authors website, Fox 2000 has '\n"," 'purchased the rights to this book to make a movie and hear rumor that Reese '\n"," 'Witherspoon might be cast as Marlena.  I think it would make a fantastic '\n"," 'movie.')\n","Review 4\n","('Jacob Jankowski recounts the wonderful time he spent with the Benzini '\n"," 'Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. During the Great Depression, his '\n"," 'parents are killed and Jacob, now penniless, has to leave vet school. He '\n"," 'learns the ins and outs of circus life, falls in love with a beautiful horse '\n"," 'rider and becomes attached to Rosie, the elephant who responds to Polish '\n"," 'commands.')\n","Review 5\n","('Water for Elephants is a compelling story told from the memory of a '\n"," 'ninety-one (or ninety-three)year-old man named Jacob Jankowski. The story '\n"," 'begins as Jacob prepares to sit for his veterinary exams at Cornell '\n"," 'University. He receives word that his parents have been killed in a car '\n"," 'accident and things go downhill from there. He ends up as part of a circus '\n"," 'and the next three-and-a-half months are mostly a living hell, except for '\n"," 'Marlena.The story goes back and forth between the present time in the '\n"," '\"assisted-living\" home where Jacob resides and his memories of the past. His '\n"," 'children/grandchildren/great grandchildren take turns visiting him, but '\n"," 'first-born son, Simon, misses the most important day of all. In the end, '\n"," 'this misstep creates for Jacob, and the reader, a most satisfying end to a '\n"," 'moving and heartwarming life story. (A bonus in this book is what the reader '\n"," 'learns about circus life in the early part of the 20th century, most of '\n"," 'which is pretty nasty.)As I care for my aged mother in her home, I am very '\n"," 'grateful that we have been able to keep her here. This book provides a '\n"," 'perspective from the viewpoint of the very elderly, who, while not as quick '\n"," 'on all fronts as they once were, are still thinking, feeling beings.Carolyn '\n"," 'Rowe Hill')\n","Review 6\n","('WATER FOR ELEPHANTS is a sweeping story of nearly epic proportions that '\n"," \"touches on the young, the old, and lost loves, all within one man's life.His \"\n"," 'name is Jacob Janowski, a grumbling old 93-year-old (or is it 90-year-old?) '\n"," 'fart living in an old folks home. Enduring his final days with other old '\n"," 'folks, Jacob loathes his surroundings and how he is treated by the medical '\n"," \"staff. Then, one day, a circus sets up stakes not far from Jacob's \"\n"," 'retirement facility and memories of life-gone-by come flooding back to '\n"," 'him.We time-travel with Jacob (in his mind, not the science fiction kind), '\n"," \"and learn of a short span that changed Jacob's life. Preparing for his final \"\n"," \"exams in veterinary school, Jacob soon learns of his parents' demise in a \"\n"," 'deadly car accident. Running away from his problems, Jacob joins up with the '\n"," 'Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth. Hired on initially as a '\n"," \"rube, Jacob's talents with animals soon come to light and he's assigned as \"\n"," 'the shows official vet. But trouble, love, and loss await him as he travels '\n"," 'the rails with the show. Falling for a married woman, trying to fit in with '\n"," \"the grunts versus the performers, battling the show's muscle-bound brutes \"\n"," \"that carry out Uncle Al's orders (Uncle Al owns the show) and trying to keep \"\n"," \"from being red-lighted (being thrown from the train), Jacob's short stint in \"\n"," \"the circus circuit changes everything about him.Author Sara Gruen's easy \"\n"," 'reading style lends itself to a fast, fun, and interesting read.

If you answered \"\n"," '\"yes,\" then this book is for you. If you answered \"no\" then this book is for '\n"," 'you too. There is something for everyone in this tremendously '\n"," 'well-researched novel of schizophrenic madmen, a possible murderer in pink '\n"," 'sequins and a towering heroine who happens to be addicted to lemonade. What '\n"," 'could be more fun?A depression-era circus can be the best place to be if '\n"," \"you're Jacob Jankowski and you just buried your parents, found out they \"\n"," 'mortgaged everything they owned to send you off to veterinary college and '\n"," 'ultimately you had nothing left to lose.Some of the central themes of this '\n"," 'page-turner are to follow your instincts, stay true to what you believe in '\n"," \"and try to survive no matter what. It's the what part that kept me flying \"\n"," 'through the book. The story shifts back and forth from Jacob at ninety (or '\n"," \"ninety-three--he's not sure) to his incredible life on the train with the \"\n"," 'Benzini Brothers Most Spectacular Show On Earth--the circus! By incredible, '\n"," 'I mean that there is a constant fear-factor woven underneath every nuance, '\n"," 'every situation is rubbed raw in not ever being entirely sure of just what '\n"," 'the future holds, or even if Jacob has one. That dread is dolled out in '\n"," 'buckets-full by the head honcho of Benzini Brothers--Uncle Al--who can have '\n"," 'you \"red-lighted\" (tossed off the train) for any number of indiscretions, or '\n"," 'simply to lesson the load. The incredible part is that, in the end, Jacob '\n"," 'not only manages to become the circus veterinarian, he also gets the girl, a '\n"," 'bereaved dog, one elephant (Rosie) and eleven horses.

I download \"\n"," '\"samples\" of all kinds of books.  If I can get hooked in the first few '\n"," 'chapters, well clearly the author deserves the book sale.That is exactly '\n"," 'what happened with Water for Elephants.  Almost immediately I was completely '\n"," 'drawn into the story.  Ms. Gruen uses an effective framing device for her '\n"," 'tale.  Nonagenarian Jacob Jankowski is telling his story in flashbacks from '\n"," 'his present in a nursing home.  And it is the story of his first job out of '\n"," 'veterinary school.  The year is 1931 and the country is embroiled in the '\n"," 'Depression.  Tragedy sends Jacob fleeing his orderly life.  Without trying '\n"," 'to, the young man winds up running away to the circus.Water for Elephants is '\n"," \"a coming of age novel, a buddy tale, a period drama, and a love story.  It's \"\n"," 'one of those rare novels that seems to captivate almost all readers.  I came '\n"," 'late to it, but I was as entranced as all those who have raved before me.  '\n"," \"Gruen's prose is strong, but it's her characters and setting that capture \"\n"," \"the imagination.

Highly recommended to all who crave a great '\n"," 'story!')\n","Review 9\n","('This book is okay if you like fighting, bickering, jealousy, adultry, and '\n"," 'just plain nasty acting people. The circus did not play that big of a role '\n"," \"in this book. The book concenstrates more on Jacob's personal life and his \"\n"," 'lust for the bosses wife. Jacob, now an old man, begins the book by going '\n"," 'back into his youth to the time he was attending vet school.  Tragic events '\n"," 'turn his life upside down and he decides to run (literally).  He winds up '\n"," 'with a circus and becomes the circus vet, although, he rarely spent any time '\n"," 'with or working on the animals. He just stood and watched animals be '\n"," 'slaughtered and then felt bad that he did not do anything. I did not like '\n"," 'Jacob. I thought he was a spinless whimp and coward. His only concern was '\n"," 'the bosses wife and how he could get her. I must say, however, the ending '\n"," 'was terrific! That probably was the highlight of the book. I do not see what '\n"," 'all the excitement was about.  If you want to read a life changing book, '\n"," 'read \"The Shack\".  Water for Elephants, in my opinion, is mostly garbage.')\n","Review 10\n","('Ninety-three-year-old Jacob Jankowski, an unhappy resident of a nursing '\n"," 'home, reminisces about his life with the traveling train circus -- Benzini '\n"," 'Brothers Most Spectacular Show on Earth -- during the Great Depression. In '\n"," 'and out of a small town, usually an overnight, the performers and working '\n"," 'men put on a show that involves animals, freaks (the dwarf and the fat '\n"," 'lady), the clowns, and all manner of circus act entertainment including a '\n"," 'tent just for \"gentlemen\" and other delights.Jacob\\'s parents died just as '\n"," 'he was about to write his final exams in veterinary school at Cornell '\n"," 'University. Because of the hard economic times, his parents mortgaged '\n"," 'everything to pay his tuition and thus he was left grief-stricken AND '\n"," 'penniless. He ends up joining the Benzini Brothers by an accident of good '\n"," 'timing and, because of his vet training, he ends up hired on to care for the '\n"," 'horses and other animals. Along the way, the circus owner purchases an '\n"," 'elephant named Rosie; she becomes a special part of this story.Author Sara '\n"," 'Gruen weaves a tale of hooking the rubes into coming to the show, '\n"," 'second-rate performances that managed to wow the audiences, boozy nights, '\n"," 'in-fighting among those with the train, backbreaking work, and other '\n"," 'fascinating details of the traveling circus. Jacob quickly assimilates into '\n"," 'the hard life and makes the mistake of falling in love with Marlena, one of '\n"," 'the performers who has a sadistic husband. Not only cruel to his wife, '\n"," 'August also beats and mistreats the animals. What will become of Jacob and '\n"," 'the rest of the members of this group of misfits, outcasts, and '\n"," 'showmen?Readers will savor the story and applaud the somewhat maudlin '\n"," 'ending. I read it quickly and found it very sweet and entertaining; '\n"," 'recommended for teens and adults. Enjoy!Caveat: there are descriptions of '\n"," 'mistreatment and abuse of animals in this book. If that is unpalatable to '\n"," 'you, you should skip this book.')\n"],"name":"stdout"}]}]}
