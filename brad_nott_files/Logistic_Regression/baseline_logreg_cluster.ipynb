I never have the internet on or use it for videos since I use my MacAir or iPhone for those things. I purchased the Apple Pencil and it works wonderfully on this iPad. For anyone who is interested in this more budget iPad for digital art or taking notes, I would recommend it. I bought a case for the iPad and it isn't as light as you might think. It has some weight to it. So if you are someone who really needs a REALLY lightweight tablet, this might not be great. The battery life so far is amazing. But, like I said before I don't have the internet on or any other app running besides ProCreate when I am using it. Maybe in two years this little guy won't be running so great, but for right now I am so pleased with my purchase. The one thing I might regret is not buying the one with more GB of memory. If you are looking into breaking into digital art, or would like to start doing digital illustrations, I would recommend this. However, for someone who has a good grasp of digital art or has used a previous tablet, consider the size of this tablet. If you need a lot of space to draw, this screen size might be too small and you should consider the 10 or 12 inch ipad Pro line. I have small hands and haven't ever used a tablet to draw before so it works great for me.\""

I had wanted the iPad Apple Pencil pair, so being able to get both for the price of just the iPad after tax was worth it. Apple got us, yet again. Not that I mind though, I love my apple products. This iPad is a great example. I will primarily be using it for digital art/graphic design/photo editing adobe type programs. I’ve used half the Wacom models, including the cintique. Haven’t had a chance to use the new iPad Pro and pencil, but for the more affordable version, this earns all 5 stars. #1, gorgeous screen, easy to set up, easy to use right out of the box. Set up is even easier now if you have another apple device. The setup prompt me to grab an apple device logged into my account already. From there I entered my passcode on my phone, before I knew it the iPad was asking if I wanted all my apps brought over, or if I wanted to start fresh. They took what I thought was already a pretty easy process thanks to iCloud, and made it even more user friendly. #2, it feels like the money you spent. Unlike other android devices I have attempted, iOS devices have never let me down in the quality department. This being said, it’s not as light as the kindle fire or what have you, but it’s going to last longer and be a more enjoyable experience over all for the extra couple of ounces. It’s not heavy compared to my MacBook, which is why I have it. Fits in my purse while still being a gorgeous screen to watch movies on. Retina displays will change your life, and ruin every other screen you look at. #3, the Apple Pencil. I get it now. And do not regret a single penny spent. The pressure sensitivity, accuracy of the accelerometer, how fast it charges, and how the pen to screen experience is closer to paper than anything I’ve ever used. I’m talking Wacom Cintique level accuracy on a tablet. It feels unreal. I love my moleskines more than the next person, but I’m worried they might be getting less use in the coming months just because this is so user friendly. I’ll be sure to add battery details or any updates, but those 3 alone were enough to sell me on the purchase.\""

    "az_help_pos = \"I wanted to write a review, not just about these headphones, but comparing them to the G4ME ZERO. I originally purchased the G4ME ONE, and upon waking up the next day, realized I bought the wrong ones. I wanted the closed version. So I ordered the ZEROs right away, and within a couple days I had $400 worth of headphones sitting on my desk. First off, both sound absolutely fantastic paired with an adequate amplifier. I gave the ZEROs a good test run with a couple long gaming sessions and listening to some tunes. I was impressed by the quality of the sound, they sounded great. Gaming is where I ran into trouble. I typically use closed headphones, but I've always used cheaper ones, which don't isolate the sound as well as higher quality headphones. Games sounded great, but talking to teammates was very troublesome. They are so well isolated, I can't hear myself talking. At all. Plug your ears with your fingers and try holding a conversation with someone, exactly like that. Even enabling the stereo mix setting that allows you to quietly hear yourself through the mic, it wasn't enough. I just could not stand it. Enter the G4ME ONE. I finally unboxed my G4ME ONEs today and plugged them in. The sound quality is close on both, but these seem to be a bit cleaner, especially on the lows. On the ZEROs, bass felt ever so slightly 'detached' from the mids, if that makes any sense. On the ONEs, the frequencies seem to blend better. They're outstanding. Mids and highs are crystal clear, bass is clean and punchy but not boomy at the extreme low end. They sound very natural all around. One small con about both headsets, is that the volume wheel on the right ear cup doesn't go to 0 volume. It only goes down to about 25% volume, which is a little irritating if you want to quickly silence your headset. A few other differences between the two is that the ONEs are an all-plastic design, whereas the ZEROs have a metal rod connecting the ear cups to the headband. How much that actually adds to the structural integrity, I don't know. The ZEROs also come in a carrying case (that nobody in their right mind would use) and so the ear cups rotate 90 degrees to fit into the case. The ONEs only rotate a few degrees, which is fine for me. The ZEROs win hands down in comfort; it's like soft, leather-wrapped pillows around your ears, and they're large, but my ears got very hot very fast (and I was wearing them in a ~55-60 degree house). The ONEs have slightly smaller felt cups and are a little denser but no temperature issues. Other than that, they're very similar.\""

      "WORST In writing this review, I would like to note two items of importance.First, I have had the opportunity to read a number of Mr. Ringo's other works and have been generally favorably impressed by their quality.Second, although the information on this book both on Amazon and the cover appears to promote it as a novel in reality it is three stories of significantly different lengths with an attempt to pull them  together with some very uninspired interludes.In summary, I found this book to be two hundred pages of boredom surrounded by several somewhat stories which appear to have been written (and probably rejected) early in the author's career.  I found the long parade of characters to be uninteresting and their motivations to be extremely confused. Would any woman with the experience, intelligence and abilities of the primary character really be the submissive housewife as characterized in this volume - impossible for me to rationalize.It appears to me that either the author or publisher scraped together anything that they could potentially sell and decided to dupe readers of the author's previous works into purchasing this inept mess.Another triumph of commercialism over integrity.\n",
