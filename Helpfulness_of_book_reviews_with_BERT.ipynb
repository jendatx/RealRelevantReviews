Its a completely different set of emotional priciples that keep men hanging in there for the long haul.Playing aloof to the guy who finally sets your heart on fire, is a sure way to put that fire out. Not to mention all the wonderful emotional thrills you would lose out on, which is reason to be in a relationship in the first place.The only reason to get this book is if:1) You are a total doormat.2) You want a guy to be your doormat, in which case you need to find a total wimp. But ask yourself is this the kind of guy who pulls your heartstrings?3) You want to have an open realtionship (seeing other people outside of the realtionship).So be Bitch at your own risk---you may well lose your soul mate when you finally meet him.</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>[-0.16153044, -1.9027398]</td>\n","      <td>Unhelpful</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["     index  ...   judgment\n","491    754  ...
